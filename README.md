# Student-Performance-Analysis
This repo contains all ML regression techniques.
As we know there are various factors that affect student performance during exams. So considering some aspects of student's background, his/her marks are predicted by using regression techniques.
In this project I've used all the regression techniques to differentiate between the accuracies.
